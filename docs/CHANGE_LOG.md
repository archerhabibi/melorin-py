# Melorin Change Log

Every change to the project (by anyone: owner, Claude, contractors) is recorded here,
newest first. Git history keeps the exact diff; this file keeps the *why*.

## It fills itself - nobody has to remember

| Layer | What records the change | Who it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Code (this file) | `.github/workflows/changelog.yml` runs `scripts/changelog_auto.py` on **every push to `main`** and commits an entry for each commit that has none | anyone who pushes, aware of this log or not |
| Server (`var/ops-log.md`) | `scripts/ops_watch.sh` (cron, every 5 min) records new deployed commit, `.env` key changes (names only), hand-edited files, container restarts/crashes | anyone who touches the server |
| Server, deploys | `deploy.yml` writes success/failure with the commit | automatic deploys |
| Server, manual notes | `scripts/ops_log.sh` | people who want to add the *reason* |

Auto entries are honest: fields the author did not supply say "_not provided by the author_".
To make an entry complete without editing this file, put single-line trailers in the commit message
(`make setup-git` enables a template): `Area:`, `Before:`, `Problem:`, `Action:`, `After:`.
A commit that edits this file itself is considered already documented and is skipped.
Commits containing `[skip changelog]` and the bot's own commits are skipped.
If `main` is protected, allow `github-actions[bot]` to bypass so the bot can push the log.

## Entry template

```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC - <who> - <area>
- **Before:** state/behaviour before the change
- **Problem:** the bug, error or missing piece (with error text / evidence)
- **Action:** what was changed to fix it (files, commands)
- **After:** verified result (tests run, health check, screenshot)
- **Ref:** commit hash / PR
```

Never write secrets (tokens, passwords, keys, `.env` values) in this file.

### 2026-10-12 - Claude (with owner) - server-side log and SSH deploy restored
- **Before:** after the reset to 27b7ee5 there was no server operations log and no automatic deployment.
- **Problem:** changes made directly on the server were invisible to git, and updating the server was manual.
- **Action:** restored `scripts/ops_watch.sh`, `scripts/ops_log.sh`, `scripts/install_ops_watch.sh` (cron, called by
  the installer) and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`; README, README.fa.md, CONTRIBUTING.md updated.
- **After:** scripts syntax-checked and the watcher was tested earlier on a scratch copy (baseline, new commit,
  hand edit, `.env` change, no secret values written). Deploy workflow needs the DEPLOY_* secrets before its first
  run; cron and workflow NOT yet run on the real server.

### 2026-10-11 - Claude (with owner) - reset to 27b7ee5 and re-applied the agreed changes
- **Before:** `main` carried extra commits (custom ports, TLS-from-files, SMTP/backup installer, server-side logging).
- **Problem:** owner asked to return to commit 27b7ee5 and redo only: main-bot token at install, automatic change
  log, README with install steps, and the optional SMTP/S3 patch refreshed for 27b7ee5.
- **Action:** history reset to 27b7ee5; then added (1) `docs`/Admin-panel optional SMTP and S3 backup patch
  (`optional-smtp-s3`, installer hunk removed because 27b7ee5 had no installer), (2) `scripts/install_server.sh`
  asking for the main bot token, local age-encrypted backups, reseller bot behind compose profile `reseller`,
  (3) automatic change log (`changelog.yml`, `changelog_auto.py`, `.gitmessage`, `make setup-git`),
  (4) README install guide, `README.fa.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR template.
- **After:** patch applies cleanly on 27b7ee5; test suite: 122 passed / 6 failed - the same 6 fail on plain
  27b7ee5 (not caused by the patch); the 7 new tests pass. Installer dry-run (stub docker): token prompt, invalid
  token handling and idempotent re-run OK. Real-server install and the GitHub workflows not yet run.
